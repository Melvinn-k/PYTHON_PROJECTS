#Exercise 1 — String Slicing
#Ask the user for their full name:
#print the first 3 letters
#print the last 3 letters.
#print everything from index 2 to the end
full_name = input("Enter your full name: ") 
print(full_name[0:3]) 
print(full_name[-3:])
print(full_name[2:]) 

#Exercise 2 — String Cleanup
#Given a user input that may have extra spaces:
#remove spaces
#convert to lowercase
#print cleaned value using an f-string
president = input("Enter the president's name: ")
print(president)
cleaned = president.strip().lower()
print(f"The president of Kenya is {cleaned}")

#Exercise 3 — List Editing
#Create a list of 5 foods. Then:
#replace the 3rd item
#remove the last item
#add one new food using append
#print the final list + type
food_items = ["rice" , "chicken", "chapati", "ugali", "cabbage"]
print(food_items)
food_items[2] = "fish"
print(food_items)
food_items.pop()
print(food_items)
food_items.append("beef")
print(food_items)
print(food_items, type(food_items))

#Exercise 4 — User Profile
#Ask the user:
#name (string)
#age (string → convert to int)
#height (string → convert to float)
#Print with an f-string and show the data type of each.
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age =int(input("Enter your age: "))
height = float(input("Enter your height: "))
print(f"My name is {name}, I am {age} years old and my height is {height} cm.")
print(type(name), type(age), type(height))
